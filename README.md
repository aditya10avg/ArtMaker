# ArtMaker

**ArtMaker** is an AI model that converts any given image into a specific style of artwork. By utilizing an open-source image-to-image generator model and a custom dataset of desired artwork styles, ArtMaker aims to generate stunning art transformations from regular images.

## Concept

ArtMaker takes an input image from the user and converts it into artwork that mimics the styles found in the dataset provided. It offers a way to create beautiful, stylized images without the need for manual editing.

## Tech Stack

- **Image-to-Image Generator Model**: We use an open-source model, such as `Stable Diffusion`, `DeepArt`, or similar, which specializes in transforming input images into other image formats.
- **Custom Artwork Dataset**: A collection of artwork styles that the user wants the model to generate. This dataset serves as the reference for the model to understand the transformation style.
- **Python**: For implementing the model and managing datasets.
- **Torch/ TensorFlow**: To facilitate deep learning and model training.
- **CUDA (optional)**: For GPU acceleration during model training and inference.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- GPU with CUDA support (optional, for faster training)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Usage

1. **Input an image**: Upload or provide the path to an image you wish to convert into artwork.
2. **Choose artwork style**: The model uses the custom artwork dataset to guide the style of the generated image.
3. **Generate artwork**: Run the model to get your transformed artwork.

## Dataset

The dataset should include images that represent the desired style of art. Ensure the dataset is organized into proper folders if multiple styles are used.

## Future Work

- [ ] Add more artwork styles.
- [ ] Optimize the model for faster image processing.
- [ ] Create a web interface for easier user interaction.
